## About

RepoBot AI is a powerful tool that bridges the gap between developers and their codebase. It uses advanced AI techniques to analyze your GitHub repositories and provide intelligent responses to your queries. Whether you're a new team member trying to understand the project structure or an experienced developer looking for quick insights, RepoBot AI is here to assist you.

Key features:
- Natural language interaction with your codebase
- Quick answers to questions about your project structure and functionality
- Code explanation and documentation assistance
- Intelligent search across your entire repository

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get RepoBot AI up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for Next.js and tRPC)
- A GitHub account and personal access token

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/akshitjain16/repobot-ai.git
   ```
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   ```
   cd repobot-ai
   ```
   

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add the following variables:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
     GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_oauth_client_id
     GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your_github_oauth_client_secret
     NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
     ```
     

5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   

## Usage

1. Connect RepoBot AI to your GitHub account using the OAuth flow provided in the application.
2. Your connected repositories will be automatically fetched and stored.
3. Select a project to work with. This selection is likely stored in your browser's local storage for convenience.
4. Use the application to interact with your codebase. For example:
   - "Show me the implementation of the `useProject` hook"
   - "Explain the `createProject` mutation"
   - "What does the `getCommits` function do?"
   - "List all the API routes in this project"
